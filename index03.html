    <h1>what are going to learn?</h1>
    <p>Greetings! The amazing journey of learning HTML is about to begin.</p>
    <p>This course covers the fundamentals of HTML. <br><b> We will start by learning what HTML is, what it is used for, and why we use it.</b> <br> We might even dive a bit into its history. <br> <b> We will also cover its role in web development and how it fits in with other languages used for web development.</b></p>
    <p>We will start by learning the building blocks of HTML, known as HTML tags. We will study how to use them, <br> when to use them, and how to manipulate them.</p>
    <p>The structure of the course is made to make your learning experience easier. Here are some pointers that will help you get familiar with the structure:</p>
    <li>This course is broken into multiple sections, each focused on a specific topic.</li>
    <li>Each section focuses on an HTML building block</li>
    <li>Each section builds upon the previous sections</li>
    <li>Each section will have text lessons and exercises to test your knowledge.</li>
    <p>Go at your own pace and have fun exploring the depths of HTML!</p>

    <h1>What is HTML primarily used for ?</h1>
    <p>Creating and structuring content on the web</p>

   <h1> What is HTML?</h1>
   <p>HTML is a markup language that structures websites using elements enclosed in tags. These tags format content, <br> create hyperlinks, and define styles. <br> Developed by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML is essential for browsers to render text, images, and other elements properly.</p>

   

   <p>HTML serves as the foundation of a website, providing structure but limited interactivity. <br> <b> CSS complements HTML by styling elements, while JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling actions like button clicks and animations. Together, they form the backbone, appearance, and functionality of modern websites.</b></p>

   <p><b>o JavaScript adiciona interatividade, permitindo ações como cliques em botões e animações. <br> <em> Juntos, eles formam a espinha dorsal, a aparência e a funcionalidade dos sites modernos.</em></b></p>

   <h1>Who invented HTML?</h1>
   <p>Tim Berners-Lee</p>

   <h1>Tags:</h1>
   <p>Here is some HTML code for an example:</p>
<img src="img/inicio tags abertura.jpg" alt="">
   <p>Let's look at a singular tag:</p>
   <img src="img/paragrafo.jpg" alt="">

<p>This is what the structure of most HTML tags looks like. You use <> to indicate the start of an HTML tag and </> to indicate the end. <br> In the middle of <> is where you put the name of the tag.</p>
<p>For example, the name of a paragraph tag is p. To indicate the start of a paragraph tag, we would write <p>. To indicate the end, we write </p>.</p>
<p>We can also put content inside the tags. The content goes between the start of the tag <p> and the end of the tag </p>. The example above shows this.</p>

<h1>Tag Attributes:</h1>
<p>Tags can also have attributes. There are some attributes that can be used with every tag, some that are specific to some tags, <br> and attributes that you can assign yourself. <br> The attributes go inside the start of the tag, <p> after the name of the tag. The attributes modify the elements. For example:</p>
<hr>
<img src="img/atributos.jpg" alt="">
<hr>
<p>We write the name of the attribute first, an equal sign = right next to it, and the value of the attribute in parentheses "".</p>

    <h1>HTML Website base:</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Although it is true that you can write any HTML you want and customize your website, there are some tags that you must include and some that you definitely should include. <br> Every time you start to write an HTML document, your setup should look like this:</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="img/Atributos  base.jpg" alt="">
    <hr>

    <p>Let's analyze and explain this.</p>

<p>The first tag we see is:</p>
<hr>
<img src="img/doctype.jpg" alt="">
<p>This tag is a special tag that should be included in every HTML document. This is the first tag you should write when writing HTML. <br> It does not have a closing tag, and all it does is tell the computer reading the document that it includes HTML. It literally says: The type of this document is HTML.</p>

<h1>The next tag is:</h1>

<img src="img/HTML.jpg" alt="">
<p>This tag should be included, and all it does is tell the computer reading the document where the HTML code begins and where it ends. <br> All of your HTML code should be written inside</p>
<hr>

<h1>The next tag is:</h1>
<img src="img/head.jpg" alt="">
<p>This tag is literally the head of the website. <br> It goes inside the <html> tag. <em>There is some content that we will be putting in this tag, but all of the HTML we write in the head will not be a visual element on the website.</em> <br> The head tag is there to write tags that give information about the website, and it is mostly used by the actual browser, not to put visual elements on the website.</p>
<hr>
<h1>The next tag is:</h1>
<img src="img/body.jpg" alt="">
<p>This tag is literally the body of the website.<em> It goes inside the html tag, and it includes all the visual content of the website. </em> <br> element that you want to add should be written here.<em> You can add text, <br> buttons, and any other element you can think of.</em> <br> This is the visual part of the website that users will see.</p>
<hr>
<h1>What is the purpose of the DOCTYPE html tag in an HTML document?</h1>
<p>To declare the document type and HTML version</p>

<hr>
<h1>Paragraph:</h1>
<p>The <p> <em>HTML element represents a paragraph.</em> <br> Paragraphs are usually represented as blocks of text separated from other blocks of text.</p>
<p><em>Here is an example of a paragraph tag:</em></p>
<hr>
<img src="img/001.jpg" alt="">
<p>Here is an example of a paragraph tag:</p>
<img src="img/paragrafo 01.jpg" alt="">
<p>Paragraphs are block-level elements, meaning that a paragraph tag takes up the whole width of it's parent element. <br> <em> What this means is that you cannot put paragraphs next to each other from left to right because, when you write another paragraph, <br> it will start in a new line.</em> You could do that with special styling, though. </p>

<p><em>One more thing to remember</em> is that text in a paragraph is displayed in one line, <em>regardless</em> of line breaks. If you write:</p>
<img src="img/paragrafo 02.jpg" alt="">
<hr>

<h1>What does the p tag in HTML represent?</h1>

<p> <em>A paragraph.</em></p>

<h1>ID Attribute:</h1>
<p>Every element in HTML can have the attribute id. <br> The id <em>of each element is unique and cannot be repeated.</em> <br> Here is an example:</p>
<img src="img/ID.jpg" alt="">
<p><em>O ID deve ser Unico.</em></p>
